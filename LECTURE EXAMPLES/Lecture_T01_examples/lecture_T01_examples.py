# Common SYNTAX ERRORS

# # Opening quotation marks
# name = "Jimmy "
# # SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal 
# # EOL stands for “End Of the Line”. It means that your codes ended without completing a certain syntax end

# # Forgetting to add a closing bracket
# print(name
# # SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
# # This exception is raised when one of the built-in functions, most commonly input() returns End-Of-File (EOF) without reading any data

# # Python is case sensitive
# Print(name) 
# # NameError: name 'Print' is not defined

# # You can't use Python keywords as variable names eg.
# class = "name"
# print(class)
# #SyntaxError: invalid syntax

# The process of resolving errors in code is known as debugging. 

# # Note declaring variables does not produce an output
# name = "Jimmy"
# # You need an output command and an argument eg.
# print(name)

# Requesting multiple inputs from the user

# print("Please list two of your favourite animals: ")

# animal1 = input("Animal 1: ")
# animal2 = input("Animal 2: ")

# print("Your favourite animals are: ")
# print(animal1)
# print(animal2)
